# Smart Bulk Create
`smart_bulk_create` method ignores errors in on or more entries in the object
 list and make sure "non-error" entries are saved in the database. This method 
 uses bipartite principal to minimize the number of database queries required 
 to save all the "non-error" objects in batches. It returns the number of 
 successfully saved entries and a list of errors generated by erroneous objects.
 
 ## Usage
 It is very straight-forward to use `smart_bulk_create`. This method has three 
 parameters:
 
 * model: Model class. (This class must contain model manager as "objects" property)
 * object_list: list of "model" type objects.
 * batch_size (optional): maximum number of objects to be saved in a single query.
 
 It returns a tuple: number of successfully saved objects, a list of tuples (object 
 with error, corresponding error)
 
 ## Example
 Let's assume that we have a model `MyModel` which is defined like this:
  ```python
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=7, unique=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

Now checkout the following execution:
```python
obj_list = [
	MyModel(name='Andy'),
	MyModel(name='Bob'),
	MyModel(name='Carry'),
	MyModel(name='Danielle'),
	MyModel(name='Bob'),
	MyModel(name='Tom'),
	MyModel(name='Zebra')
]

smart_bulk_create(MyModel, obj_list)
```

The output is:
```python
(6, [(<MyModel: Bob>, IntegrityError('UNIQUE constraint failed: smart_bulk_create_mymodel.name',))])
```
The output means that, 6 entries out of total 7 have been saved successfully. And 
the object`<MyModel: Bob>` got an error due to unique constraint failure. If there
 were several entries with error, the list of errors would contain them all.
